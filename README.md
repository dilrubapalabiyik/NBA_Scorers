# NBA_Scorers
Goal is to recreate the analysis from author Todd Whitehead's article on fansided.com

Tood Whitehead recently wrote an article for fansided.com and Nylon Calculus titled, "Ranking the best and worst scorers in every offensive role" (article can be found here: (https://fansided.com/2017/08/09/nylon-calculus-ranking-best-worst-scorers-every-offensive-role/) in which the author used how NBA how players tried to score (transition, pick and roll, etc.) to cluster them into offensive roles. From there the author looked at the best and worst scorers, using points per possession, to rank players in each cluters.

All of the data comes from http://stats.nba.com/.

My goal is to become more comfortable with the data located on the NBA's website and to do that I will try and recreate the analysis done in the formentioned aforementioned article.
